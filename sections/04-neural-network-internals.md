# Neural Networks Internals

Going in:
- Input: a sequence of tokens. Can be theoretically infinite, but not computationally feasible.
- Parameters: weights `w`. Usually billions of these.

In the middle:
- The NN is a giant mathematical expression. Each expression is fairly simple.

Going out:
- 100,277 numbers, considered as a probability distribution over the vocabulary.
